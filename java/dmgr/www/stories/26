The Peacock and The Crane

	


One day a peacock met a crane and said, “So sorry for you. You have so dull feathers. Look at the fine colours of my feathers."


“Well!’ replied the crane, “your look are brighter then mine. But whereas I can fly high up into the sky. All you can do is to strut about on the ground."
