 The Oak Tree and the Reeds





The Oak tree always thought that he was far stronger than the reeds.


He said to himself “I stand upright in storm. I don’t bend my head in fear every time the wind blows. But these reeds are really so weak."


That very night blew a storm and the mighty oak tree was uprooted.


“Thank god!" sighed the reeds, “Our way is better. We bend but we don’t break."
