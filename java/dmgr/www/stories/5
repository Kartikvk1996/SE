Hungry Wolf

	


This is a short story about Hungry Wolf.



Once, a wolf was very hungry. It looked for food here and there. But it couldn't get any. At last it found a loaf of bread and piece of meat in the hole of a tree.



The hungry wolf squeezed into the hole. It ate all the food. It was a woodcutter's lunch. He was on his way back to the tree to have lunch. But he saw there was no food in the hole, instead, a wolf.



On seeing the woodcutter, the wolf tried to get out of the hole. But it couldn't. Its tummy was swollen.



The woodcutter caught the wolf and gave it nice beatings.
