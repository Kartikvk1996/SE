Tip of the day  Displaying one page within another = Transclusion  Including the contents of a template page on a different page (by surrounding the page name with double braces, i.e. "{{}}" and leaving out the "Template:" prefix) is called transclusion .  This allows the other page to be automatically updated whenever the template page is updated.  Besides templates, pages in the following namespaces can be transcluded:   Category:  Help:  Portal:  User:  Wikipedia:   The only difference between transcluding these and templates is that you must include the prefix (followed by a colon) with the page's name inside the double braces.  Images also can be transcluded, but this is done using double square brackets instead of braces.  Here are some examples of transclusion:  {{ Pic of the day }} · {{ Help:Contents }} · [[ Image:Wikipedia-logo.png ]]   Prior tip – Next tip – Tips library    Read more:  Wikipedia:Transclusion     Become a Wikipedia tipster – Tips library, by subject  To add this auto-updating daily tip to your user page, use {{ totd }}     Additional searches    Search Frequently Asked Questions                Search the help desk archives                     v  t  e     Basic information on Wikipedia        Main Help   directory  menu    FAQs  Reference desk  Help desk       About Wikipedia     Administration   Purpose  Who writes Wikipedia?
